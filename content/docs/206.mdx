# Problem Statement
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

# My Solution
```python
def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head
    ret_val = self.reverseList(head.next)
    head.next.next, head.next = head, None
    return ret_val
```

Explanation
* None

# Best Solution
```python
def reverseList(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    prev = None
    curr = head

    while curr:
        next_node = curr.next  # Store next node
        curr.next = prev       # Reverse link
        prev = curr            # Move prev forward
        curr = next_node       # Move curr forward

    return prev  # New head
```

Why is this better?
* Save space

Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(1) for iterative (Best solution), O(n) for recursive (My solution)

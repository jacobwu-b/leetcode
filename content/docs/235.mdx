# Problem Statement
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```

# My Solution
```python
def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
    # Both p and q are in root's left subtree
    if root.val > p.val and root.val > q.val:
        return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
    # Both p and q are in root's right subtree
    if root.val < p.val and root.val < q.val:
        return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
    # P and q are in root's left and right subtree, or vice versa, or root is one of p and q
    return root
```

Explanation
* See above

# Best Solution
```python
def lowestCommonAncestor(root: Optional[TreeNode], p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
    while root:
        if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
            root = root.left  # Move left
        elif p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
            root = root.right  # Move right
        else:
            return root  # This is the LCA
    return None
```

Why is this better?
* Same logic, cleaner code

Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: O(h)
* Space Complexity: O(1) in iterative approach (Best Solution), O(h) in recursive approach

# Problem Statement
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

# My Solution
```python
def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
    i, j = 1, 2
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        i, j = j, i + j
    return i
```

Explanation
* Memoization
* climbStairs(n) = climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2)

# Best Solution
```python
def climbStairs(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    prev2, prev1 = 1, 2
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        curr = prev1 + prev2
        prev2, prev1 = prev1, curr
    return prev1
```

Why is this better?
* It's not

Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

# Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

# My Solution
```python
def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
    if not root:
        return
    new_left = self.invertTree(root.right)
    root.right = self.invertTree(root.left)
    root.left = new_left
    return root
```

Explanation
* Recursion

# Best Solution
```python
def invert_tree(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
    if not root:
        return None

    # Swap the left and right children
    root.left, root.right = invert_tree(root.right), invert_tree(root.left)

    return root
```

Why is this better?
* Same logic, cleaner code

Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree, O(log n) for balanced trees, O(n) for skewed trees

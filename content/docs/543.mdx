# Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

# My Solution
```python
def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    def helper(root):
        # Return (Longest path to root, longest path through root, longest path without root)
        if not root:
            return (-1, 0, 0)
        left = helper(root.left)
        right = helper(root.right)
        # Longest to root = max(left to root, right to root)
        longest_to_root = max(left[0], right[0]) + 1
        # Longest thru root = left to root + right to root
        longest_thru_root = left[0] + right[0] + 2
        # Longest no root = max(left thru root, right thru root, left no root, right no root)
        longest_no_root = max(left[1], right[1], left[2], right[2])
        return (longest_to_root, longest_thru_root, longest_no_root)
    return max(helper(root))
```

# Best Solution
```python
def diameter_of_binary_tree(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    diameter = 0

    def depth(node):
        nonlocal diameter
        if not node:
            return 0

        left_depth = depth(node.left)
        right_depth = depth(node.right)

        # Update the diameter (max path length between two nodes)
        diameter = max(diameter, left_depth + right_depth)

        return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1

    depth(root)
    return diameter
```

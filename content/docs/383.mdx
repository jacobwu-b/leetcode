# Problem Statement
Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.

Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true
```

# My Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
    ransomCounter = Counter(ransomNote)
    magazineCounter = Counter(magazine)
    for key, value in ransomCounter.items():
        if magazineCounter[key] < value:
            return False
    return True
```

Explanation
* See above

# Best Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def canConstruct(ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
    magazine_count = Counter(magazine)

    for char in ransomNote:
        if magazine_count[char] == 0:
            return False  # Not enough of this letter
        magazine_count[char] -= 1  # Use the letter

    return True
```

Why is this better?
* Lower memory usage (one counter instead of two)
* Avoids extra iteration (once over ransomNote instead of two)

Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: O(m + n) where m is len(ransomNote) and n is len(magazine)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

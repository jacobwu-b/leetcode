# Problem Statement
Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

# My Solution
```python
def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
    if not head:
        return False
    i = head
    j = head.next
    while j:
        i = i.next
        j = j.next
        if not j:
            return False
        if i == j:
            return True
        j = j.next
        if i == j:
            return True
    return False
```

Explanation
* We can detect a cycle in a linked list using Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm (also known as the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm). It uses two pointers:
    * Slow Pointer (slow) moves one step at a time.
  	* Fast Pointer (fast) moves two steps at a time.
  	* If there’s a cycle, the two pointers will eventually meet.
  	* If there’s no cycle, fast will reach the end (None).

# Best Solution
```python
def hasCycle(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
    slow, fast = head, head

    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next          # Move one step
        fast = fast.next.next     # Move two steps

        if slow == fast:          # Cycle detected
            return True

    return False  # No cycle
```

Why is this better?
* Same logic as mine, but formatted more concisely.

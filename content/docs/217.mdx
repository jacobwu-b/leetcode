# Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The element 1 occurs at the indices 0 and 3.
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: All elements are distinct.
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

# My Solution
```python
def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    hs = set() # hs is a hashSet
    for i in nums:
        if i in hs: return True
        hs.add(i)
    return False
```

Explanation
* HashSet to track seen elements

# Best Solution
```python
def containsDuplicate(nums: list[int]) -> bool:
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```

# Problem Statement
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

Example 4:
```plaintext
Input: s = "([])"
Output: true
```

# My Solution
```python
def isValid(self, s):
    stack = []
    for c in s:
        if c in ["(", "[", "{"]:
            stack.append(c)
        else:
            if not stack:
                return False
            open_bracket = stack.pop()
            if open_bracket == "(" and c != ")":
                return False
            if open_bracket == "[" and c != "]":
                return False
            if open_bracket == "{" and c != "}":
                return False
    return not stack
```

Explanation
* Use stack to store the latest open bracket

# Best Solution
```python
def isValid(self, s):
    stack = []
    mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}

    for char in s:
        if char in mapping:
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'  # Pop from stack or use a dummy character
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:
            stack.append(char)

    return not stack
```

Why is this better?
* Same logic, cleaner code through mapping variable and dummy character

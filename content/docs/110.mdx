# Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced. A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.


Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: root = []
Output: true
```

# My Solution
```python
def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
    def helper(root):
        if not root:
            return 1
        left = helper(root.left)
        right = helper(root.right)
        if not left or not right or abs(left - right) > 1:
            return False
        return max(left, right) + 1
    ret_val = helper(root)
    return isinstance(ret_val, int) and ret_val > 0
```

Explanation
* Compare left subtree height and right subtree height. If height differs more than 1 or if a subtree is not balanced, return False.

# Best Solution
```python
def isBalanced(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
    def check_height(node):
        if not node:
            return 0

        left_height = check_height(node.left)
        if left_height == -1:
            return -1  # Left subtree is not balanced

        right_height = check_height(node.right)
        if right_height == -1:
            return -1  # Right subtree is not balanced

        if abs(left_height - right_height) > 1:
            return -1  # Current node is not balanced

        return max(left_height, right_height) + 1

    return check_height(root) != -1
```

Why is this better?
* Same logic as mine, but formatted more concisely.

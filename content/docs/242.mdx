# Problem Statement
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

# My Solution
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    mapping = defaultdict(int)
    for c in s:
        mapping[c] += 1
    for c in t:
        mapping[c] -= 1
    for key in mapping:
        if mapping[key] != 0:
            return False
    return True
```

Explanation
* Use mapping to keep track of frequency of each character in s, then correspondingly remove each occurrence in t. Assert all values are 0 at the end for a valid anagram.

# Best Solution
```python
def is_anagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    return Counter(s) == Counter(t)
```

Why is this better?
* Same logic, cleaner code

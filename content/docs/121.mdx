# Problem Statement
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

# My Solution
```python
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    max_price = [0] * len(prices)
    for i in range(len(prices) - 2, -1, -1):
        max_price[i] = max(max_price[i + 1], prices[i + 1])
    max_profit = 0
    for i in range(len(prices)):
        profit = max_price[i] - prices[i]
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
    return max_profit
```

Explanation
* Keep an array of max_price after day[i], e.g. prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] -> max_price = [6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0]
* Maximum profit each day[i] is max_price[i] - prices[i]

# Best Solution
```python
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    if not prices:
        return 0

    min_price = float('inf')
    max_profit = 0

    for price in prices:
        min_price = min(min_price, price)  # Track the lowest price seen so far
        max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)  # Calculate max profit

    return max_profit
```

Why is this better?
* Same logic, uses iteration instead of recursion
* More space efficient

Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(1) for best solution, O(n) for my solution

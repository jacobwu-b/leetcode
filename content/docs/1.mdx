# Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
```

# My Solution
```python
def twoSum(self, nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target):
                return [i, j]
```

Explanation
* Brute Force, O(N^2)

# Best Solution
```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if (target - num) in seen:
            return [seen[target - num], i]
        seen[num] = i
```

Why is this better?
* Uses a hash table to store seen numbers.
* Checks for complement efficiently in O(1) time.
* Efficient lookup and insertion into hash table. Runs in O(n) time complexity.

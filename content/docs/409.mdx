# Problem Statement
Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome.

Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
```

# My Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
    counter = Counter(s)
    odd = 0
    pairs = 0
    for key in counter:
        odd += counter[key] % 2
        pairs += counter[key] // 2
    return pairs * 2 + min(odd, 1)
```

Explanation
* Count the frequency of each character in the string.
* Use pairs of characters to contribute to the palindrome length.
    * If a character appears an even number of times, it can be fully used.
    * If a character appears an odd number of times, (count - 1) characters can be used (leaving one unpaired).
* If thereâ€™s at least one odd frequency character, we can place one in the center, adding 1 to the result.

# Best Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def longestPalindrome(s: str) -> int:
    char_count = Counter(s)
    length = 0
    odd_found = False

    for count in char_count.values():
        if count % 2 == 0:
            length += count  # Use all characters if even
        else:
            length += count - 1  # Use only the even part of an odd count
            odd_found = True

    return length + 1 if odd_found else length  # Add 1 if any odd count exists
```

Why is this better?
* Same idea, different syntax

Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(1)
